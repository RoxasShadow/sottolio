Sottolio - È sopraffino
========

Porting of [Sottaceto](https://github.com/RoxasShadow/Sottaceto) in javascript written in ruby with opal.

Just like Sottaceto, sottolio is a game engine to make in a simple way visual novels for andr—your internet browser. The games written with sottolio can run everywhere. You need only internet browsers which support javascript, HTML5 and the canvas object.

The scripts (you can find them in `app/script/`) are read by a DSL and are very self-explanatories, even more than Android's XML.
Backgrounds, musics and the other stuff are divided in the respective folders in `resources/`.
