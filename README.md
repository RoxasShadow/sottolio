Sottolio - Ãˆ sopraffino
========================

Porting of [Sottaceto](https://github.com/RoxasShadow/Sottaceto) in JavaScript written in Ruby thanks to Opal.

Just like Sottaceto, sottolio is a game engine to create in with ease visual novels. These games run everywhere, you only need a~~~n internet browser which supports JavaScript and HTML5~~~ decent internet browser.

The scripts (check `compiler/scripts`) are pretty self-explanatory (even more than Sottaceto's ones, actually).

Backgrounds, musics, and other stuff are kept inside `game/resources/`.

How to run
==========

```
$ cd compiler
$ bundle install
$ rake
```

In some seconds your web browser will be opened with the game ready to be played.

The [demo](http://www.giovannicapuano.net/sottolio/) is also available in the web, as well the [video gameplay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV_Z5OeBmg&feature=youtu.be) (it's a bit old tho).
